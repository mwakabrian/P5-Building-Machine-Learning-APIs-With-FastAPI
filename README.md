# P5-BUILDING-MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT WITH FAST APIS

This project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to perform various machine learning tasks. Below are the key components of the project:

- **combined_data.csv**: This file likely contains the combined training and testing data used for the project.
  
- **encoder.joblib**: This file likely stores a saved encoder object used for encoding categorical features in the data.
  
- **K Nearest Neighbors_pipeline.joblib, Logistic Regression_pipeline.joblib, Random Forest_pipeline.joblib**: These files are  serialized pipelines containing different machine learning models trained on the data. The file extensions (.joblib) indicate that these files were created using the scikit-learn library.
  
- **main.py**: This script serves as the main entry point for running the machine learning pipeline.
  
- **Patients_Files_Test.csv**: This file likely contains the testing data used for the project.
  
- **Patients_Files_Train.csv**: This file likely contains the training data used for the project.
  
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
  
- **Sepsis.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook might have been used for data exploration and analysis.
  
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files or patterns that Git should ignore when committing changes.
  
- **LICENSE**: Contains the license for the project.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed according to the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone or download the project repository.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

### Running the Main Script

To run the main script, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### API

This project also includes an API for deploying the machine learning model. The API is built using Uvicorn.

To run the API, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the API server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use Docker to containerize the application.

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t ml_project .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 ml_project
```

This will start the containerized application, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Use Code with Caution

This README provides a basic structure for understanding and using the project. For detailed instructions and further information, refer to the respective scripts and documentation within the project.
